spitballing: things we want to investigate



0\. Discuss the limitations of observation data.



1. Species diversity - count how many unique species are in each park. break down into category, to see which categories are the most/least diverse in each park. compare this to the total observation count across all species (per park).



2\. Population - identify species with the highest total observations across all parks. Investigate methods to extrapolate species population in each park. See how this compares to classifications of conservation status. Use this, and actual population statistics to discuss the validity of our findings. Then link to the following...



3\. Conservation status - investigate which parks contain the most at-risk species. how does this compare to the species diversity of parks (section 1)? are some parks disproportionately home to vulnerable species. should more funding be allocated to these parks? which categories of species are most at-risk, and how does that link to the biomes of the parks with many at-risk species?



4\. Interpretation \& Policy - Based on the above, what recommendations could be made for conservation priorities?
